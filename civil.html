        The sanctioned intake for UG currently is 120 and 18 for PG in each program. From the year 2008, UG program was granted academic autonomy status from VTU, allowing to tailor our curriculum to cater for growth of knowledge, skills, and attitudes among students. With three postgraduate M.Tech programmes (Construction Technology, Environmental Engineering, and Transportation Engineering and Management,) the department has been a recognized VTU research centre since 2002. The Department is also recognized as AICTE QIP Research centre since 2012 and is AICTE ADF Research centre since 2018. This transformation elevated the department from primarily undergraduate department to a hub of research-based learning.
