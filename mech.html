   <h1> About Department </h1>
   <p style="font-size: 25px;">
        Department of Mechanical Engineering was one of the three branches started when BMS College of Engineering was established in 1946. In the past seven decades, the department has seen lot of progress in academics, research and consultancy activities. The Department offers one PG program namely M. Tech. in Machine Design and UG Program. Both the programs are granted academic autonomy by VTU in the year 2008 that has enabled us to have our own curriculum to enable and empower the students with enhanced knowledge, skill sets and positive attitude. The department was accredited in the year 2004 for 3 years and in the year 2008 for 3 years.</p>
